This is a simple demo that shows how to use Firebase realtime database and displaying the data inside a ListView.  
You can add, edit, or delete items, and the database database gets updated and the changes are instantly reflected in the UI.  
There are two modules:
* app: This module contains the Java implementation.  
* kotlinapp: This module contains the Kotlin implementation.

# Important Note
**The project DOES NOT contain the google-services.json file, you must create your own Firebase project and use your own google-services.json file in order to be able to use this project. 
You can check this post [here](http://mobiledevhub.com/2018/01/14/android-how-to-set-up-firebase-in-your-project/) where I thoroughly 
cover how you can integrate Firebase in your project, or feel free to check the official documentation [here](https://firebase.google.com/docs/android/setup).**
